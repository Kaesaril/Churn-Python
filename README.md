In this notebook we will walkthrough detailed statistical analysis of Titanic data set along with Machine learning model implementation.

Emplearemos algoritmos de clasificaci√≥n para intentar estimar si una persona sobrevive o no al Titanic.

The Titanic dataset, often referred to as "titanic.csv," is a popular dataset used for teaching and practicing machine learning techniques. It contains data on passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which famously sank after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage in 1912. The dataset typically includes various features (columns) that describe each passenger, along with a target variable indicating whether the passenger survived or not.
